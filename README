Hello, these would be the simple instruction notes for the Grade Calculator.

How to setup?
    After downloading all of the files, simply go to app.py and run the python program, this will open up the terminal and provide you the link to open the calculator.
    [Step by Step Process]
        1st - Download all files [styles.css under static folder, index.html under templates folder, and app.py(doesn't need to be under any folder)]                           How the link looks like
        2nd - Simply run the program by going to running the app.py, this will give you the link to the calculator. [The link is UNDER the BRIGHT RED WARNING SIGN (e.g. Running on >>> http://127.0.0.1:5000 <<<)]

How to use?
    - Simply input any grades between 0 - 100 to any of the submissions. 

Importan Notes:
-If you manage to get a required grades of < 75 or > 100, it may be not possible for you to reach the passing grade.


How does it work?
    [One Input] --- [Best for knowing how much you need in the OTHER terms to reach the passing grade 75.]
        -If you entered one grade into one of the three boxes provided, it will solve for your required grade in the other two boxes that you have not filled in.
    
    [Two Inputs] --- [Best for calculating how much you need in ONE term to reach the passing grade]
        -If you entered two grades into two of the boxes out of three provided, it will solve for the last box you have not filled in.
    
    [Three Inputs] --- [Best for calculating the total grade you got in ALL of the terms (Prelims, Midterms, and Finals)]
        -If you filled all of the boxes, it will calculate the overall result.
